		<p>As I write this, I find myself in the awkward, almost adolescent, stage of life between college and work. A new way of life opens its doors to me, leading to both vast opportunity and ironically, an extremely ridged set of rules. As excited as I am to begin the life that I’ve been working toward for so long, the uncertainty surrounding it, and the longevity of the stage of life it represents, inherently bring a lot of fear.</p>

		<p>The working world after all, does not exactly hold a positive reputation.</p>

		<p>Anecdotes from older friends and family, and accounts from media are frighteningly pessimistic. It seems that a majority of people don’t find satisfaction from their work. And reports support these fears.</p>

		<p>Estimates for those who aren’t satisfied at work range from 50% to as much as 80%. As a recent college graduate that emerged from college with a (perhaps naïvely) optimistic view of my potential in the world, that number is shockingly discouraging. I may have as little of an 80% chance of enjoying my work (a whopping third of my life) until I retire. That’s not the rosy real life-fulfilling picture they painted for us in college.</p>

		<p>I give this background to give context to the headspace that I write from. And to perhaps relate to my fellow graduates who might be in a similar, and often unspoken about, place.</p>

		<p>While my perspective of the working world offers next to zero experience, I would hope that is exactly why it proves useful. An outside viewpoint, though as I’ve said certainly not an objective one, may provide a refreshing perspective on a culture that those who are already deep within might find it difficult to recognize.</p>

		<p>What my either refreshing or naïve perspective finds compelling is the increasingly common experiment of reducing working hours from the standard 40 hours. As technology advances, opportunities for reduced work become more common and more feasible. In recent years, multiple companies and a few countries have experimented with schedules that deviate from the traditional 5-day, 40-hour work weeks.</p>

		<p>There are numerous variations of these flexible schedules. Some opt for the same number of hours crunched into just 4 days. Others attempt even more dramatic schedules of either 4, 8-hour days, or even 5, 6-hour days. The argument: that increased work-life balance and work satisfaction will motivate enough of an increase in work efficiency to result in the same overall productivity in a reduced set of hours. What I will primarily focus on in this article are schedules that reduce the total weekly work hours to below forty, but similar principles hold for the 10-hour, 4-day work week.</p>

		<p>While France’s 35-hour week has become increasingly well known, a number of other countries also have reputations for low weekly working hours. Denmark, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Ireland, and Germany all boast average work hours well below 40 hours. Some accounts have claimed these countries have nation-wide 4-day work weeks, and while those reports are often exaggerated, as a whole these countries put a high priority on work-life balance and work flexibility that leads to a variety of alternative work schedules. Schedules range from working at home on Fridays to both spouses working only 3 days a week for 6 total work days. It is perhaps not a coincidence that with this priority on work-life balance that many of these Scandinavian countries also boast world leading rankings on the UN’s World Happiness Report.</p>

		<p>On a smaller scale, numerous individual companies have run experiments on divergent work schedules. One New Zealand-based company experimented with a 4-day, 32-hour work week and found increased worker satisfaction with no decrease in job performance despite the work being done in 4 days instead of 5. Workers were more engaged in their work, and were able to meet the demand for efficiency required by reduced work hours.</p>

		<p>That being said, there is certainly not a unanimous consensus on the overall benefits and feasibility of these types of schedules. Certain companies have said they find that these schedules increase hiring costs, don’t allow for the competitiveness required to stay in business, and certain industries, including customer-based industries, require constant customer service that can’t be accommodated by these types of schedules.</p>

		<p>However, with the potential benefits in work-life balance, mental health, and job satisfaction, I question why more American companies aren’t experimenting with this option.</p>

		<p>At the risk of delving into a topic that could fill bookshelves, I’ll turn to American culture to explain this resistance.</p>

		<p>The differences between the U.S. and countries that are more willing to attempt reduced work hours, are largely based on the underlying ideals these countries center around. Most Scandinavian countries practice forms of democratic socialism (anyone paying any attention to the Democratic Primaries should know that phrase well). This political philosophy is only one example of the larger cultural philosophy that dominates these countries.</p>

		<p>To different degrees, all the countries who rank lowest in work hours (Denmark, Netherlands, Ireland, etc.) have cultures centered around collectivism. The “we” is more emphasized than the “I”. Their system of high taxes, combined with high government support is both a cause and symptom of this mindset. It is also the reason they are able to implement flexible work hours. In these systems, the employee has more rights than the employer. Work programs such as benefits for part-time work, mandatory vacation days, and contracts that make it challenging to fire employees all support a system of high work-life balance and protect the employer from the company.</p>

		<p>The U.S., conversely, is dominated by capitalism and a culture that centers around “I”. Companies reign supreme, and have substantially more freedom in what policies they choose to implement for their employees. Lack of protective measures for employees force them to accept less than optimal work conditions. And a drive for profits urge companies to provide less than optimal work conditions.</p>

		<p>The capitalist system rewards companies willing to put their profits above work-life balance and employee satisfaction. The logic follows that if a car manufacturing employee can produce 4 engines in 8 hours of work, profits will increase if that employee works 10 hours to produce 5 engines, and will decrease if he works 6 hours to produce only 3 engines.</p>

		<p>This model ignores the diminishing returns of increasing working hours. Not only does job satisfaction increase with the ability to spend more time with your family and doing things you enjoy, but so does work productivity. As humans, we are not meant to focus for 8 straight hours. After a certain amount of time, our focus drains, as does our output. Some reports argue that on average, we only actually work for 2 hours and 53 minutes of an 8-hour work day. This finding has two implications: First, we can be a lot more productive and second, we don’t actually need to be at the office for 8 full hours. Regardless of if that number is exactly accurate, I would argue that 8 hours is a gross overestimation of the time we can actively be productive at work.</p>

		<p>Certainly, the increase in work efficiency needed for these schedules to be beneficial would take an adjustment from both companies and employees. While we are used to periodic socializing, reading the news, scrolling through social media, even online shopping occasionally during our working hours, 6 hours of work doesn’t allow for wasted time. On the employer side, events like 2-hour long meetings would have to be trimmed to include only the necessary points and people. I think that alone is a cause we can all get behind.</p>

		<p>However, employees have a self-interest in making these adjustments. As much as the carrot and the stick model of motivation has been championed and implemented for decades, it has been shown to lack fundamentally once our basic needs our met. Once we have a level of income that supports our need to eat, drink and have shelter, stronger motivators such as meaning, community, and autonomy matter much more. By offering rewards that match these motivations (flexibility in schedules, more free time) employees would be willing to put in the effort to make the necessary changes.</p>

		<p>Beyond the barriers produced by capitalist forces on companies, cultural barriers are also pervasive. In the U.S., work hours seem to be glorified. The number of hours per week you work is a source of bragging rights. Those who work 50, 60, 80 hours are exalted as role models, and the same can be said for hours of sleep. The social pressures associated with a culture that glorifies these measures, operates deceptively effectively against the case for reducing work hours. Employees are less willing to push for it, and employers are also stigmatized for implementing policies that would make them look less prestigious or competitive.</p>

		<p>While the role of a capitalist system and work hour prestige cannot be understated, another cultural standard plays an equal if not more profound role in the barriers against work reform. That is the steadfast mindset held by many company executives: “because we have always done it that way”.</p>

		<p>Precedent itself is immensely challenging to overcome. And in a system and work culture as established as the one in the U.S., it can be particularly difficult. Companies have developed a system and people have bought into it. For less progressive companies and less progressive CEO’s a change as fundamental as a deviation from the well-established 9 to 5 is not even up for entertainment. Despite the potential benefits, established traditions stand hard fast in the way of change. Those who have played by these rules for years and lifetimes will put in substantial effort to validate that they were right in doing so, even if there is evidence of better solutions available.</p>

		<p>Precedent and tradition, while they do serve an important role, often come to obstruct innovation and progress. That is why new, progressive companies are able to make big impacts. They are willing to change what has always been done in favor of something better. In fact, that is how anyone, anywhere makes an impact. Look at the scientists who have made profound discoveries, athletes who have changed the way their games are played, civil rights leaders who have started nation-wide movements. Everyone who has had a significant influence on their field has not done so by sticking to the books. Almost by definition they had to do something different. Something that would allow them to rise above everyone else who was too afraid or too stubborn to step away from tradition and precedent. Something that went against those who said no “because we have always done it that way”.</p> 

		<p>So my refreshing, young, perhaps idealistic mind clings onto hope that there is a better way forward. A way where 80% of people don’t have to lack satisfaction in what they do. Because if the only reason you are saying no to something is that you have always done it that way, perhaps it is about time to say yes.</p>
