		<h1>Female Athletes are Paving the Way for Female CEOs.</h1>
		<h2>What the world would look like with all female teams.</h2>

		<p>A new era of female athletics is underway. Led in the media by the US Women’s National team, supported in depth by countless professional and novice athletes, and built even more fundamentally on the shoulders of the female civil rights movements. It is an exciting time to live. And it fills me with power and aspiration to see a female sports team capture a nations spirit the way the Women’s National Team was able to do. The significance extends far beyond a  World Cup title (a more than pride worthy accomplishment in itself). It signals the emergence of equal female representation in the traditionally male dominated representations in soccer. And to go a justified step further, it signals the emergence of female representation in the male dominated realm of sport as a whole.</p>
		<p>In 1972, the federal civil rights law, Title IX, was passed. Initially, the law aimed to ban discrimination within public education. Neither athletics nor sport is mentioned anywhere in the actual words of the law. But the law has come to take on a new meaning. Now it is largely associated with equality of female representation in collegiate and high school sports. As a female college athlete, the impact of Title IX was wound fundamentally into my life. I saw it everywhere. We had a Title IX office as part of our athletic department tasked with the sole responsibility of gauging out the intricacies of the implications of the rule. Criticisms were ubiquitous, ranging from the unfairness it presented to male sports teams, to its general ineffectiveness. I don’t intend to argue that Title IX is the cure to female representation in sports—it certainly has its problems—but I do think, if nothing else, it represents an introduction of the conversation about the lack of females in athletics.</p>
		<p>Whether or not Title IX is fair or effective, after its passing, female participation sports undeniably increased (and it is arguably the reason I had the opportunity to swim in college, so my personal gratitude goes out to it). Participation in high school sports increased from 294,000 to 3.2 million—surely nothing to scoff at. That being said, women to this day, remain the minority in sports, both as athletes and as administrators. Women still have 1.3 fewer opportunities to play high school athletics than boys. And only 43% of women’s teams have female coaches. Interestingly, this number dropped from 90% after Title IX was passed when female team coaching positions became more profitable.</p>
		<p>While I’d like to believe the problem and solution exist exclusively in the sporting bubble, the world as a whole mimics these trends. Like athletics, the business realm has shown improvements in the last 50 years, and like athletics, it is not nearly there yet. The statistics regarding gender representation look eerily similar. 6.4% of CEO’s of Fortune 500 companies are female. To put that in a more relevant metric for me, and many of my fellow recent college graduates, the percentage of male CEOs alone (93.6%) constitutes an A letter grade. To give you another angle, 30% is considered the critical mass: the percentage of representation required for a minority to have a meaningful influence. Not even close.</p>
		<p>So, athletics is a microcosm for the state of the world. That is certainly true. And is apparent in many other realms besides gender representation—sports provide narratives on racism, politics, economic inequality (I’ll stop there for the sake of your own time). But I would argue that sports are more than just a sample of the real world. That would mean the solution requires changing the real world and then athletics will follow. That is too simplistic of an answer. I’ll throw one more statistic at you: 95% of Fortune 500 CEOs played college sports—again an A letter grade (and you know that’s a big number because its larger than the percentage of male Fortune 500 CEOs). Its not a coincidence that athletics and corporate leadership intersect. College sports, and sports in general, develop leaders. Inspiring greatness in a sports team is not far removed from inspiring greatness in a business. The skills are the same. It is hard to argue that there is not some sort of causal relationship. This relationship is where the real significance of equality in sports emerges. It not only represents fairness, but functions as a mechanism to build more equality in the world.</p>
		<p>If you’ll bear with me, I’ll take it one step further. Imagining an all male corporate or political board is not challenging (although perhaps a little disheartening). I’ve seen plenty of pictures of these rooms (generally also printed without much strain on the colored ink cartridges). Much more challenging is to imagine a meeting room or political office populated solely by females. What would that look like? What would happen? An interesting thought experiment certainly, but perhaps it doesn’t stop there. What about an all female sports team? Not so challenging to image.</p>
		<p>I spent four years immersed in this thought experiment. What happens when you remove the statistical demographic leaders and allow the statistical minority to lead themselves? Well, in the case of the Women’s National team, a World Cup Title, but I’ll focus on experience here as to not get elitist. I developed a voice; confidence; the ability to listen to others and cooperate as a unit; to lead a team to pursue a common cause. I had the fortunate experience to be on a team that particularly fostered leadership. I was forced to speak my mind. Forced to have uncomfortable conversations. Forced to take risks and step out of my comfort zone. So I got to develop my leadership skills. Importantly, I got to develop them in an environment where I was not overshadowed or led to feel outnumbered.</p>
	 	<p>Female teams give women a particularly powerful benefit in terms of leadership development because it gives them unoppressed practice. Practice to gain leadership skills in an environment where they are not the minority. They are not going to be subordinate. It allows them to go through the delicate, fragile process of leadership skill building in a supported environment. Just like an adolescent is more sensitive to their environment in their development to adulthood, so too are young leaders. I benefited enormously from a leadership development environment where I was allowed to fail. Allowed to learn and grow and develop these skills with the confidence I would be listened to, and not overpowered.</p>
		<p>It is my belief that this atmosphere is an equally important benefit of females in sports, on par with inherent justice. It provides an environment of leadership development that is not accessible to women in the business world. Or the academic world. Or the political world. It allows for women to become strong leaders before being thrown into a world where they are inherently underrepresented.</p>
		<p>I have yet to bridge that gap. I am fresh into the real world: the mysterious post-education life that we are prepared for perhaps in intellectual knowledge but certainly not in emotional practice (another opinion for another time). I feel and see myself as more confident in leadership than my non-athletic classmates. But I have yet to put any sort of leadership into action. That perhaps will be the bigger test of myself and this viewpoint. I have been a leader when it is expected of me. When I am told I am allowed to do so. So can I do it when I am told, indirectly of course, that I am not allowed to?</p>
