		<p>On Monday, June 15th 2020, Neil Gorsuch changed my life. Let me tell you why I owe my future happiness to a white, middle-aged conservative.</p>
		<p>Despite his claims, Donald J. Trump and his administration have not been kind to the LGBTQ community. Previous to 2016, Trump openly voiced disapproval of gay marriage. In his bid for president, his vocal opinion changed, but his legislative action has not.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>1)Trump attempted to ban transgender service in the military due to “medical costs” (this was a right once refused to Black Americans as well).</li>
			<li>2)The Justice Department reversed a federal policy that applies the 1964 Civil Rights Act (yes, that one) to transgender workers and entered a court case arguing that it does not apply to gay workers.</li>
			<li>3)The Trump Administration withdrew guidance that Title IX applies to anti-transgender discrimination in education.</li>li>
			<li>4)The Trump Administration proposed rescinding nondiscrimination protections for transgender people under the Affordable Care Act.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>I could continue, but negativity is not what this article is about.</p>
		<p>Outside of executive action, the balance of power grants Trump with one other powerful tool: the power to nominate judges to the Supreme Court. Currently, due to the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy and the death of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Trump has been afforded two Supreme Court nominations. These additions swung the polarization of the Court from a 5-4 liberal majority to 5-4 conservative majority.</p>
		<p>With the potential of four more years of a Trump presidency, that number grows even more frightening. At age 87, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the oldest Supreme Court justice by over five years. Her closest counterpart is liberal Justice Stephen Breyer at 81. Both justices have the potential to give up their seat over the next four-year term, which opens the possibility for Trump, should he be re-elected, to nominate a whopping four Supreme Court justices, leading to a 7-2 conservative majority.</p>
		<p>While the thought of a seven justice conservative majority in an office that is appointed for life is truly terrifying, that is the topic of another article and one of the most pressing reasons to vote (no matter how you feel about Joe Biden). For now, I will keep this discussion devoid of these horrifying theoreticals.</p>
		<p>As it stands, Trump has only had two nominees: Brett Kavanaugh and Niel Gorsuch.</p>
		<p>Thus enter the judgments of two, (shockingly) white, men into the lives of individuals across the nation. The decisions they make over the rest of their working lives will impact the way the constitution is read and what rights belong to whom for the rest of the history of the United States. With my right to marry a relative infant in terms of Supreme Court cases and with substantially more work to do to for LGBTQ rights in the workplace, schools, and even in our private lives, these two men have the potential to fundamentally change the outcome of my life.</p>
		<p>Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark Supreme Court case on marriage equality was decided five years ago, today. While Supreme Court cases are intended to set precedent, there are a number of ways Obergefell could be effectively undermined without overturning it directly. While the case protects against marriage discrimination, and even includes phrasing that extends protections against discrimination to “the constellation of [marital] benefits”, a number of cases have already attempted to chip away at the extent of this ruling. For instance, the Arkansas Supreme Court upheld a law preventing same sex couples from having both their names on their child’s birth certificate. While the ruling was later overturned by the Supreme Court, attempts like this could eat away at Obergefell until there is essentially no substance to the ruling beyond being able to call yourself “married”. With Obergefell v. Hodges decided by a simple 5-4 majority, the two new judges have the potential to significantly flip the narrative.</p>
		<p>Until recently we had yet to see what side these judges would stand on. However, with the recent string of landmark cases surrounding polarizing social issues, the judges set their foundations.</p>
 		<p>On Monday, the Supreme Court made a decision that applied to three separate cases before the court. All the cases regarded being fired due to being gay or transgender, and asked the question of whether the term “sex” in the 1964 Civil Rights Act applied to gay and transgender individuals. The Act, as it reads, prohibits discrimination in the workplace based on “race, color, religion or sex”.</p>
		<p>According to LGBTQ activist groups, Gorsuch was all but a lost cause. Not only did he revere the late Justice Anton Scalia whom voted against Obergefell with a fiery descent, but he voted against the Supreme Court case to overturn an Arkansas law that prevented same sex couples from having both their names on their child’s birth certificate (sound familiar?).</p>
		<p>Kavanaugh was more of a wild card, but his conservative leaning and past appointments under the Bush administration also did not do much to point to him favoring gay rights.</p>
		<p>Despite his history, on Monday, Gorsuch took the nation by storm by siding with the both the liberals and, another surprise, conservative Justice John Roberts. Together, they extended the 1964 Civil Rights Act to apply to sexual orientation and gender expression. Gorsuch, even wrote the majority opinion.</p>
		<p>Gorsuch’s stance on this case sets the stage for his career. While it certainly does not mean he will always side with the liberals, it allows for the possibility that Gorsuch could be a swing vote for them in a number of other cases. This possibility has enormous consequences for a number of other social causes including racial equality, gender equality and reproductive rights. His decision on this case in particular, allows me to hope that this 5-4 conservative Court could continue to progress toward equality for me and my future family. Almost more importantly, it means the country has the potential to not regress on its social progress. The protections established in Obergefell appear a lot safer than it did only a few weeks ago. It also means that I am afforded the luxury to continue to daydream about my wedding day, the names of my children, and the glowing smile of my future wife.</p>
