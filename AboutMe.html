		<h1>Me. This Blog. You.</h1>
	</div>

	<div class="text">
		<p>I will skip my background here because if you are reading this you probably already know me, credentials are boring anyways, and I don't want to re-write my resume (for the God-knows-how-many-ith time. Although on that note, if you are hiring, please hmu I need employment).</p>

		<p>This blog is a Coronavirus project aimed at developing some skills that will serve me well in the workplace (as well as direct me on what exactly that workplace will look like). It has two parts:</p>
		<br>

		<ol>
			<li>Develop my writing skills because writing my thoughts is fun and cathartic and because writing will undoubtedly serve me well in whatever profession I choose.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Develop my web development skills because coding is fun and cathartic and because coding knowledge will undoubtedly serve me well in whatever profession I choose.</li>
		</ol>
		<br>

		<p>With that said, I want to thank you for visiting this site and exploring it enough to make it to the About Me page. This is all a learning process, and part of learning involves other opinions and ideas, so it is inherently limiting if I keep this blog to myself. If you have any feedback, criticism, opinions, or just want to say hello, please feel free to contact me. I will likely respond unless I see your message and get distracted and forget.</p>

		<br>
		<p class="centered">Thank you all. Have a great day. Have a great life.</p>
