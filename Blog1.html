		<p>While I hesitate to add to the endless stream of media discussing Coronavirus, I can’t help but be drawn to the topic for the sheer novelty of the discussions it produces. It seems that humanity in its natural monotony has been thoroughly picked over by artists and writers for millennia. With the world as it is today, human nature opens up parts of itself that have so often (if not always) remain hidden. So I, like many others, will digress into a discussion of the apocalypse we now inhabit.</p>
		<p>Perhaps, even still, I can discuss a narrative that has not been as overly analyzed as the inter and intrapersonal effects of living in isolation, or the political climate that has inevitably wound itself into the moral debates around human life. Coronavirus has brought with it massive changes to our social and cultural standards. Handshakes are a thing of the past, and personal space bubbles have indefinitely expanded to a standard 6 feet. What I want to look at here, however, is a shift in a much smaller cultural norm. A norm that until this crisis sharply interrupted societal normalcy, was so imbedded in our interactions that it often escaped our attention.</p>
		<p>We Americans have come to use the phrase, “how are you?” as synonymous with a greeting. It flows off the tongue after “hello” so naturally that it is almost part of the same phrase. The answer here is almost always a variation of “good”, “fine”, or for the more outwardly enthusiastic in our society, “wonderful! How are you?” With the exception of the later group I would argue that not all, perhaps not even most people are doing “good” at any one moment.</p>
		<p>Instead, I believe we respond so automatically with a positive response because, for the most part, the person inquiring does not genuinely care about the answer to their question. They are looking for a brief, fictitiously cheery greeting that checks all the boxes for socially approved communication. A truthful answer digressing into whatever particular inner turmoil the responder is facing does not fit the mold of appropriate social behavior. Even for those we know closely, such abrupt displays of honesty would likely cause the inquirer to be taken aback, even if they then followed up with care and understanding.</p>
		<p>This customary response to the “how are you?” greeting is an anecdote of the underlying assumptions we make about the status of our peers when we interact with them. Not only are we expected to present ourselves as if we are doing well, but we are expected to approach people as if they, too, are doing well. It is the classic chicken and the egg: both expectations are born from each other. We present to others with a mask over our inner hardships because the person interacting with us expects us to. And the person interacting with us approaches us assuming all is well because they expect us to respond as such.</p>
		<p>Exceptions to this trend exist when we know something has gone wrong: someone was laid off; a family member died. Then, the classic “how are you?” changes meaning. We present it with the assumption that the person is not alright, and we do not expect a positive response in return. What is unusual, however, is that we often get a positive response none the less. Even with an approach intended to imply a negative state of being, the responder often responds with, “I’m doing alright” or “doing as best I can” because it remains awkward to deviate from the default of joy.</p>
		<p>This cultural standard is the context with which Coronavirus enters. It creates a crisis where almost everyone is not doing ok, and for a very clear, easily understandable reason. The default becomes that people are not alright. And, consequently, we shift our approach.
		“How are you?” has not changed. It is still part of our greeting. But both our assumptions behind it and our response to it have. “How are you?” now means “How are you dealing with this? Are you alright?” The assumption is the same as if you had been laid off: that the answer is not good. But what changes here is that the responses can now match the negative assumption. We are allowed to be truthful about how we are doing and the hardships we are facing because the societal standard that we are all supposed to be ok has collapsed.</p>
		<p>The result:</p>
		<p>Connection! Beautiful, authentic, vulnerable, human connection. We are willing to tell the truth for once about the difficulties in our lives, and the receivers, for once, are willing to hear it. They can relate to our hardships and they are there to console and assist and empathize. Even relative strangers have an immediate connection via this shared suffering. And the ability to both be vulnerable with each other and to relate to each other serves to connect us.</p>
		<p>In a time that finds us so isolated, connection is invaluable, and it protects us against the mental anguish that comes from a lack of physical interaction. Numerous studies have shown that social connection, and having a support system is one of the strongest predictive factors for successfully overcoming depression, addiction, and other mental health disorders. As a species we require social interaction to function our best. It is as important to our mental health as sleep or good nutrition. So in a time when we are lacking physical connection, it is important to maximize the depth of the connections we do have. The acceptance of the vulnerable honesty of the challenges we are experiencing is allowing for just that.</p>
		<p>It is my hope that the destigmatization of honesty can be a societal change that doesn’t revert at the end of this crisis. Our old society faced a stigma against expressing hardship. It is my belief that by changing the social norm of always having to present ourselves as cheery and happy and thriving, we can start to chip away at that stigma. Every single person we interact with is, or has, gone through a challenging time. And most people will again. By opening up our ears and hearts to these people, and approaching them with no assumption about their state, we can start to allow for the honesty and vulnerability that are so fundamental to our connection and our well-being.</p>
