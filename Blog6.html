		<h1>Why Is Nobody Talking About This?</h1>
		<h2>So many young adults are in crisis, but no one wants to talk about it.</h2>

		<p>Perhaps it is a sense of disappointment at what it truly means to live in the “real world”; a slow adjustment to the status quo that everyone must go through at some point in their lives. Perhaps we simply come to believe the falsehoods everyone else believes.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the real world is full of joy and passion and dreams. Perhaps it is full of sadness and work and reality.</p>

		<p>Perhaps our fall to the status quo is inevitable. Perhaps it is one we can fight against.</p>

		<p>Perhaps it will be ok. Perhaps it will not.</p>

		<p>Perhaps it is all of this. Perhaps it is none.</p>	

		<p>Whatever it is, it is a crisis.</p>

		<p>That word makes it sound quite dramatic. I am not dying. I am not bankrupt. I am not facing any real obstacle other than my own mind. But philosophers would argue the basis of any crisis is the mind, so in the name of philosophy, I will give credit to my struggle.</p>

		<p>I am in what some have termed a quarter-life crisis. A moment in your early or late twenties where you realize the world is not all it is cracked up to be. The careers you dreamt up in college turn out to be monotonous, 60+ hour-a-week day jobs staring at a computer screen under fluorescent lights. The life you spent years creating in your mind becomes riddled with mortgages, debt, divorce, and unfairness. You start to realize life sort of sucks.</p>

		<p>This is very pessimistic, I know. But if it were positive, it wouldn’t be a crisis.</p>

		<p>Is it all that bad? Likely not. Do people still manage to find satisfaction with their jobs despite being locked in a dim box for most of their lives? I would wager yes. But regardless, the “real world” is a fundamental challenge of the world view we have grown up with as kids.</p>

		<p>Our happy, carefree childhoods come crashing down as we see what the next, and longest stage of our life holds. A whole lot of work. A whole lot of the same.</p>

		<p>Our childhoods are a period of no responsibilities. We have no one to care for except ourselves. No bills to pay, no mouths to feed, no worries to preoccupy our minds besides which tree to hide behind in hide-and-seek. College gives us a taste of responsibility, but we still have remarkable freedom and flexibility, a relatable and physically close group of friends, and relatively few responsibilities.</p>

		<p>The wall hits when we step into the real world and find that our only dream gets to be work. You can be anything you want, but it has to pay the bills and has to be successful and has to allow you retire one day and probably won’t give you any free time to do anything else you might ever want to do in life. Better freaking love your job because that is ALL you get.</p>

		<p>We quickly realize that we have expenses. We have kids to educate, houses to spend our lives paying off, medical insurance prices worthy of entire body transplants, parents to support who have worked their whole lives but still don’t have enough to retire. Not the roses and butterfly’s college convinced us of.</p>

		<p>There is a fundamental discrepancy between what we have been led to believe, and the reality of the world. And the quarter-life crisis faces this discrepancy head on.</p>

		<p>Our beliefs are challenged, and either we were wrong, or the world is.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the unrestrained optimism that grew from a childhood of dreaming is simply naive and false. Perhaps the real world is full of work, monotony and surviving. That is just the way it is. Perhaps it is inevitable that we will be forced to face this reality at some point. Most of us will be forced to work unsatisfying job in order to pay the bills. That is life. The only thing you have to do is get your head around it. Perhaps every person that faces this wall passes through it eventually and settles into the jobs and lives just like everyone else. Perhaps this reality is not as bad as it seems, and you will adjust. Maybe it is, and you just have to accept it.</p>

		<p>The other option is that we are right to dream, and the world is wrong to deny us. Perhaps the systems that the world operates by force us into these roles that are not necessarily inherent. It doesn’t HAVE to be but the world makes it so. The corporations that dominate our education and healthcare, and convince us we need to spend to be happy; the increasing wealth gap that keeps the rich thriving and the poor working tirelessly to meet their basic needs; the government that lets these corporations go unchecked in order to secure elections. Perhaps these forces are driving our world into working, consumerist, competitive chaos. And we are either too busy trying to keep our heads above water to realize or to do anything about it. Or we are so convinced that the world must be like this, by both the corporations and the thousands of our peers who also accept it, that we too fall into the abyss.</p>

		<p>I don’t know the answer. I would be shocked if it was exclusively one or the other. And even more shocked if it could be thoroughly explained by one of two ten-sentence paragraphs.</p>

		<p>My crisis, however, had led me to search tirelessly for the answer to ease the uncertainty that dominates my mind. To know what my life holds. And either work on getting over the expectation gap I developed as a child, or work on departing from (or even fixing) the society that traps us in these roles.</p>

		<p>Though perhaps my desperate search for an answer will not lead to resolution at all. Perhaps this question is not even the crisis, and the answer is not the solution. Perhaps the turmoil is not one to be solved with a simply binary. Perhaps the resolution of the quarter-life crisis is less about finding the answers, and more about realizing that you will be asking the questions for them for the rest of your life.</p>
