		<h1>Why We Settle For Easy</h1>

		<p>Perhaps this is a rather depressing world view but it seems to me that the majority of people are unhappy.<p> 

		<p>I say this primarily in the context of work, but I think it extends to our personal lives, family lives and the inner workings of our minds as well.</p>

		<p>It seems that most people have settled. Settled for a job they don’t particularly enjoy. A lifestyle that is closer to easy than exciting.</p>

		<p>Perhaps part of this settling is just people growing up. They are past the wild life of college and its time to ease into the expected nine to five grind followed by an often rushed workout, hastily made dinner, watching some TV, going to bed, repeat. Dear God, if that is my life.</p>

		<p>Perhaps that reality is something that everyone has thrust upon them post-adolescence, and it is only a matter of time before I accept it and find myself in the same rhythm. But at the moment I am passionately, angrily, absurdly, doggedly against it.</p>

		<p>I have yet to wrap my head around the mundane, unsatisfactory and meaningless life that is office work in the capitalist system. I refuse to accept that over a third of my life is spent sitting at a desk, looking at the plain white walls of an office, making money so that what? I can have a nice car? I can pay my hulu subscription? I can have the latest shoes?</p>

		<p>To be sure, there is something to be said for work preceding passion. People come to be passionate about what they do. However, I argue that the amount of passion surrounding increasing profits for a CEO is inherently limiting.</p>

		<p>And it is true that I may also be taking a dramatic view, where this lifestyle is in reality manageable. But as I tick away the limited years of life, I am unsatisfied with manageable.</p>

		<p>I want to thrive.</p>

		<p>I further defend my position with the fact that humans are not meant to exist the way our society decrees. There is a reason depression is the highest it has ever been and it is not only because it is being destigmatized (which is an incredibly valuable advancement despite the argument that it is being over diagnosed. It saves lives. Period). It is because the environment that we have adapted to thrive in has changed faster than evolution can keep pace with.</p>

		<p>We were not meant to sit at a desk for eight hours a day. We were meant to run ten or more kilometers a day. There is a reason exercise is a natural anti-depressant.</p>

		<p>We were not meant to stare at a computer screen in a white-walled office for eight hours a day. We were meant to gaze upon the wide green and blue and brown expanses of the earth. There is a reason nature is a natural anti-depressant.</p>

		<p>We were not meant to be connected only by text messages and emails and cordial conversations with our coworkers. We were meant to spend lifetimes with a tribe that relied on deep knowledge and trust of each other in order to survive. There is a reason social interaction is a natural anti-depressant.</p>

		<p>With the rigid structure of the corporate world we are denied these fundamental necessities. The expectation is to adhere to the status quo or risk…</p>

		<p>Risk what?</p>

		<p>Uncertainty, perhaps. Judgment.</p>

		<p>Not success. The most successful people were successful for the very sake that they went against the status quo.</p>

		<p>If those are the only limiters, why are so many people stuck adhering by the rules “society” sets forth?</p>

		<p>Perhaps because those limiters are deceptively strong. Uncertainty is the reason many people do not leave abusive relationships or will not quit jobs they hate. Judgment is the reason people don’t take risks, or hide their true self in favor of a more societally accepted one. It is the reason people are afraid to speak truly about their mental health, or come out to their parents or family.</p>

		<p>Perhaps people settle because it is easier. Easier than facing uncertainty, risking failure, or being viewed as divergent from the norm.</p>

		<p>In fact, it is my hope that ease is the reason so many people find themselves spending their lives making money just to make money. If it is simply easier to settle, then the only barrier to not settling is some hard work. It leaves open the possibility that a life of passion and variety and meaning is attainable. It’s just beyond the other side of hard. But it is there.</p>

		<p>I can do hard. I can’t find something that does not exist.</p>

		<p>What glimmers hope for a hard barrier and not an impossible one is that there does seem to be a select few that escape monotony. Not everyone’s life is miserable or even mundane. There are people who are living their best lives, experiencing the world, making the most of the limited resource of time.</p>

		<p>Some perhaps are doctors, others engineers, maybe even a few lawyers. Others are coaches. Others are skydiving instructors.</p>

		<p>Numerous “happiest professions” google searches have concluded that the profession alone is not the answer I’m looking for.</p>

		<p>While I am sure there are people who truly enjoy the culturally sought after professions, it seems all too many are there because that is where society tells them they should be. Prestige, like money and like comfort, seems like a sore alternative to living.</p>

		<p>What I believe sets these people apart is a disregard for what they are “supposed” to do. The forces of uncertainty and judgment don’t influence their actions. They do what they want.</p>

		<p>Not with a lack of effort. They often put their whole souls into what they do. Likely because they actually want to do it.</p>

		<p>Its not the easiest way for sure. There are a lot of pressures and voices that say that is the wrong way. Turn around. Follow the track. These can weigh heavy. But I am not scared of hard. I am not scared of putting up a fight. What scares me way more than hard, is finding myself spending years chugging along at a job that I can’t wait to leave at the end of the day. Spending my days at a computer to make money to buy things that will impress other people. Spending the single life I have settling into the expectations of society. What scares me way more than hard, is settling for easy.</p>
